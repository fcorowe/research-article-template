# Template for Journal Articles

This repository contains a template for writing up research manuscript integrating technology from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) and [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). I love this set up because it:

* facilitates the integration of text and code;
* automatically generates a bibliography from in-text citations which can be incorporated by providing DOIs;
* enables collaboration for multi-authored manuscripts;
* can automatically generate outputs in multiple formats, including PDF, HTML and WORD extensions;
* enables addition of comments which is a beloved feature for many to use Word.
