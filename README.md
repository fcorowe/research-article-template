# Template for Journal Articles

This repository contains a template for writing up research manuscript integrating technology from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org), [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org). I love this set up because it:

* facilitates the integration of text and code;
* automatically generates a bibliography from in-text citations which can be incorporated by providing DOIs;
* enables collaboration for multi-authored manuscripts;
* can automatically generate outputs in multiple formats, including PDF, HTML and WORD extensions;
* enables addition of comments which is a beloved feature for many to use Word.

The folder contains two templates:

1. a Rmarkdown template 
2. a Quarto template

This repository contains a Quarto template for Nature Scientific Data which was created by [Christopher T. Kenny](https://github.com/christopherkenny) and can be downloaded directly from his [repository](https://github.com/christopherkenny/scientific-data).
